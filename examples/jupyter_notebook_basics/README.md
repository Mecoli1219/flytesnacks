Jupyter Notebooks revolutionize workflow development by combining code execution, documentation, and visualization in one interactive environment. Through Flyte's integration, you can develop and test your workflows remotely while maintaining production-ready scalabilityâ€”eliminating the gap between development and deployment.

## How to Use the Interactive Mode?

Interactive mode is a feature included in [FlyteRemote](https://docs.flyte.org/en/latest/api/flytekit/design/control_plane.html) aiming at supporting entities (tasks, workflows, launch plans, etc.) registration and execution within interactive environment like Jupyter Notebook. To use the interactive mode, you just need to create a FlyteRemote object with `interactive_mode_enabled=True` to interact with Flyte backend. Then you are free to go!
